## It isn't a stable version and it has some bug, don't download it!


JukeLoop makes Jukeboxes a lot cooler.  Jukeboxes automatically start, repeat, and loop through and records in adjacent chests or hoppers.  Finished discs can be deposited into hoppers directly below jukeboxes. 


Features
===

 * Update to 1.11.2!
 * Records will start playing automatically even after a server restart. (locations of jukeboxes stored in config)
 * Rotate through records in a chest placed adjacent to the jukebox(Will add it back in next version.)
 * Remove some features.


Commands
===

 * None
 * Will add "/jukeloop reload" in next version.


Permissions
===

 * 'jukeloop.use' - players with this permission will automatically have their jukeboxes repeat.
